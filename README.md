# Missing Closing Div Tag Bug in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: a missing closing tag for a &lt;div&gt; element.  The missing closing tag causes unexpected layout shifts and can be difficult to diagnose without proper browser developer tools.  The solution is to ensure all opened tags are correctly closed.

**Bug:** The `bug.html` file contains a `&lt;div&gt;` element without a closing tag.

**Solution:** The `bugSolution.html` file fixes the error by adding the missing closing tag.
